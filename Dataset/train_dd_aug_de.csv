8409,3,"A mesmerising portrait of this sad, compulsive life."

8484,3,"A movie is already a kind of sitcom ig when the lines work, the sense of humor is there and the actors are humanly engaged."

8510,3,"The work of an exhausted, withered talent unable to seize power on their own."
8511,3,"A comedy in action, a fast-paced game, and a cheergetful, simplistic plot that is linked to the premature birth of a baby boy."
8515,2,But you'd never guess it from performances.

8559,2,"Personal Velocity is a very blunt docu-dogma simplicity, but Miller lingers on invisible, almost mental nuances, and departs into explorations of memory and longing."

8565,1,"The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a good-looking, empty desire to find himself, and his vicious personality and bad behavior would look great if the movie knew what to do with him."
8566,1,But don't leave much.
8567,1,"Life can sound so dull, it's just hard to think."
8569,3,"On the way, Shyamalan offers many hints - myriad signs if you like - that there is a much larger, more telling story behind the familiar comic surface 狛? than one in which York green men come to earth for harvest."

8588,0,We're not going to have enough budget to deal with that kind of crap.

8607,1,"Being bowed before Chekhov, as director Michael Cacoyannis shows with somber seriousness in this new film adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, is a particularly annoying handicap."

8610,3,"It would be an awkward viewing experience for the super-provincial New Yorker if it were not for her fantasy character Melanie Carmichael, 26, who has injected her with an enormous infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic."

8613,1,To excavate Byatt's plot for the purposes of a Hollywood romance is pointless.
8614,3,"Oh yes, rise."
8615,1,"Cacoyannis's vision is much less mature, interpreting the play as a plea for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phstolasms that follow the supposed grandeur of her own past."

8618,3,"Unyielding, but powerfully dramatic."

8625,0,"Be warned, those who fall into depression before watching އfilm may even try to drown themselves in a lake afterwards."
8626,4,An impressive hybrid.
8628,1,This is a much lower bid than the cable-only one-hour play-time.
8629,1,"The beautiful images and the solemn words do not conceal the slavish equilibrium of the vision - LRB Godard - RRB, nor the gorgeous piano acoustics and strings on the soundtrack drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice Jack and me."
8632,3,"In fact, even better."
8633,2,"It's the film equivalent of a sweaty old man in a raincoat, searching for cheap porn."

8661,4,Peter Jackson and Co cast an enchanting spell over us again and fulfill virtually all expectations that a veteran Tolkien fan or cinema lover neophyte could have.

8677,1,"Not only will it undoubtedly play in European markets, where Besson is a brand, and Asia, where Shu is an institution, but it will likely be found familiar and insufficiently cathartic to the American public."
8678,4,"A taut, sobering film."
8679,3,"It's quite well written, not to mention cleverly cut, so it certainly doesn't feel like a film that's swell to the two and a half mark."

8694,1,... contains hardly any laughs and even less surprises.
8695,0,"... a dismal, short movie at its heart; an exploration of the emptiness at the basis of the ruthless merriments of the 1920s... the ending of the film prompts the question: ""What was it?"""
8696,3,"He pays tribute to ""the playful spark of nonconformity,"" focused on what the hibiscus grandly called his ""angels of light."""
8700,2,Routine and pretty silly.
8702,2,"The Recovery's fantastic performance did not exactly demonstrate what makes Vincent tick, but perhaps it would have been a fraud if someone had clearly explained why."
8704,3,The pictures of the film give the company a backbone and give the emotional edge in its eventual demise.

8719,4,Fast and wonderfully mounted and extremely meticulous.
8720,3,"This breezy, vibrant caper film becomes a soulful, haunting meditation on the way we were, and the way we are."

8736,2,"If you look carefully you will see that these are the ""big twists"" - but this doesn't make the film any less entertaining."
8738,4,The fact that Haynes can maintain and destroy the facades that shape the genre and texture of his character at the same time is a wonderful fulfilment of truthfulness and narrative grace.

8761,3,A living testimony to the strength of the eccentric and the strange.
8764,4,"The video will deliver breathtakingly visually stunning, sometimes sublime performances across the audience, as well as a fascinating insight into the subculture of extreme athletes whose backgrounds carry the X into the Games."
8766,2,"Diving to ḿ in Charleston rhythm, this story does have the allure of old news that has finally found its proper opening - LRB-?"

8771,3,"In The Pianist Polanski says what he has long wanted to say, against the roots of his own fears and obsessions, and allows nothing to stand in his way."
8772,1,Not the slightest bit of Afghan misfortune ensued that this noble warlord was consigned to the dustbin of history.
8774,4,Hartley has enough quirky and satirical touches in the script to keep the film entertaining.
8777,2,Goodfella's Young Guns was the perfect match in this easy to skip hay-making game.
8783,2,"Hilarious musical comedy, as opposed to accents thick as mud."
8784,2,"Although melodramatic and predictable, this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five Filipino-American citizens and their desperate efforts to find love."
8786,3,Bon appetit!
8787,0,"Rifkin no doubt fancies himself a bit of a Hubert Selby Jr., but his entire script contains no trace of honest poetry, it's just raw and relentless exploitation."
8788,0,The thing is crap.
8789,2,Stuffed with hundreds of witty jokes.
8790,1,"Sorvino is a snobbish and glitzy princess, and only when poor Hermocrates and Leontine compare their nascent love tales miserably is the film brought truly to life."
8792,2,The philosophical reflection of the dialogue versus the distasteful display of the movie's plot is surprisingly entertaining.
8793,1,"Their weighty themes are too heavy for teenagers to take on, but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other caustic subject matter to really appeal to teens."
8796,1,"This year, I'd be hard pressed to conceive of a film more revered than Evelyn."
8797,3,"The ring sounded quite engrossing to me, mainly because of its elegant colour and sound quality."
8798,0,The catch: they're stuck with a script that stops them firing on all cylinders.
8799,0,Virtually every attempt at humour here is a joke.
8801,4,What begins in a docu-drama gains clout in a multitiered story.
8804,1,"In ""Ichi the Killer"" Takashi Miike, Japan's wildest filmmaker, gives us a criminal more emotionally than Batman..."

8808,2,"Oops, this time she really did it."
8810,4,"-LRB - Danny Huston gives a startling performance, which skillfully fühlte, gradually reveals a real human soul buried under the grin of a fascinating snake."
8812,1,"Like his screenplay, through which nurses plug gaping holes in the plot that lead an entire Olympic swimming team to trek the Earth's shadow, Swimfan's characters appear motivated by nothing less than a boring, brainkilling hangover."

8815,0,It's too long and unfocused.

8829,1,"Perhaps, given the film's old-fashioned storyline and pornographic way of barricading itself in sweltering apartments, clothes and parties, the film Fabian's bumbling about authenticity has something inadvertently comical about it."
8830,1,Why should anyone cast the terrific Jackie Chan in a film full of stunt double and special effects?
8831,3,Intimate and panoramic.
8833,0,"It is a contour free, inconsequential act, which relies on the viewer to do most of the work."

8839,4,The film is small in size but perfectly formed.
8840,3,"Although he is intrepid about engaging with attractions that stretch beyond sexual identity, it does not really help him display Antonio's true feelings to us... But his spiritual life will at least make us think."
8841,0,Most of the dialogue has encouraged me to put raw dough in my ears.
8842,3,"Truly a pan-American film, with moments of real insights into urban heart."
8843,3,You can and will take a turn from oddly humorous to boringly sentimental.

8862,4,Jeffs created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of balance dialogue and sharp eloquence.
8863,2,"Ong decides to portray Ah Na's life as an easy, weightless fairytale, the most uncomfortable detail of which seems as if it is melting in the face of the novelist's sober optimism."
8864,3,"Kwan is a master of the shadows, tranquility, and the noise and flip, and Lan Yu is a film that is disarmingly inhabited."
8865,4,"As with The Full Monty, this should energise the mood of the audience and make them sing again long after the credits have ended."

8868,3,This great action comedy-smash will get one's hair topping the tropes.
8869,0,"What exasperates me the most is not so much that a good cast is valued, but that a film that was so righteous bereavement was rejected in favour of a false spiritualism."
8870,3,The film is a really good alternative for young women.
8871,2,"If it wasn't for a sentimental decision that says more about Cal than the film or the character as a whole, Freundlich's globetrotting could have been one of the more daring, astonishing films of the year."

10869,2,"An oppression of odd gags, quirky color schemes and kitschy visual puns that can be appreciated both as an abstract Frank Taschlin comedy and as a playful recap of the artist's career."
10870,0,This film suffers from two fatal illnesses - a lack of vitality and a story that is unpolished and lacking in narrative.
10871,1,Not necessarily offends viewers with a sick sense of humour.
